## Overview
End-to-end project that predicts urban traffic flow using weather and traffic data. The repo contains data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, predictive models (Random Forest, GBM), and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to present findings in a stakeholder-friendly way.

This project demonstrates:
- Full data pipeline: ingestion → cleaning → EDA → modeling → deployment  
- Reproducible notebooks and scripts for handover and review  
- A user-facing dashboard (Streamlit) to visualize results and allow scenario exploration

---

## Highlights
- **Models used:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), XGBoost (if used)  
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit app for interactive visualisations and what-if exploration  
- **Reproducibility:** Jupyter notebooks and scripts with fixed seeds and instructions  
- **Impact:** Identifies key weather features (precipitation, temperature, visibility, etc.) that influence traffic flow — useful for city planners and transport operators

---

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, numpy, matplotlib/plotly, seaborn, streamlit  
- **Tools:** Git, requirements.txt, virtualenv/venv  
- **Optional:** SQL for data extraction / local storage
